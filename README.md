# Trigonometric Convex Hull

Optimizing a convex hull using trigonometric elimination.

## Algorithm details

1. Calculate center point from average positions.
2. Sort points based on distance from center.
3. Eliminate center points using triangle intersection.
4. Sort remaining points based on theta angle from center.
5. Connect remaining points in sequence.
